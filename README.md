#ccbc-contacts-gmail

Push ccb individuals' contact information to your gmail contacts.

This will create a contact group in your gmail account called "{ccb subdomain}.ccb" and populate it with all of the individuals that have 'profile listing' enabled.  (In addition, these contacts will also be assigned to the system group "My Contacts" because this is the group that gmail uses when syncing contacts to phones.)

This is a three step process:

1. You will be redirected to google's website and prompted to allow this application access to

* your gmail contacts (so we can update them)
* your profile information (so we can know your name)
* your email address (so we can identify your record in ccb)
* offline access to your contacts (if you choose to resync periodically, so we can update them while you are sleeping)

2. We will look up your record in ccb based on your email address (to determine who and what you can see in order that we may respect individual's privacy settings) and confirm that you want to continue.

3. Contacts will get created or updated. (Only those contacts that we create will get updated. If you already have an existing contact with the same name in another group, it will NOT be touched.) When a contact record is updated, it is completely overwritten-- so if you make changes to these contact records on your phone, those changes will be lost. Instead, you should change them in ccb.

You can revoke the permissions that you've granted to this application via the link at the bottom of each page.
